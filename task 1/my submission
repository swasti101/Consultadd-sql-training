sql query to create labeled sample data from unlabeled image predictions table.
sampling strategy is to order in decreasing order of scores and sample every third data starting with the first untlil
      we find the first 10,000 positive samples and similarly starting from end and taking every third negative sample
      until we find 10,000 negative samples also.


OPTIMISED SQL QUERY : 
WITH score_rank AS (
 SELECT image_id, score, IF(score >= 0.5, 0, 1) as weak_label
 FROM unlabeled_image_predictions
);
WITH positive_samples AS (
 SELECT image_id, weak_label, row_number(OVER ORDER BY score DESC) as r_num
 FROM score_rank
 WHERE r_num % 3 = 1 AND weak_label = 0
 LIMIT 20
)
WITH negative_samples AS (
 SELECT image_id, weak_label, row_number(OVER ORDER BY score ASC) as r_num
 FROM score_rank
 WHERE r_num % 3 = 1 and weak_label = 1
 LIMIT 20
)

SELECT image_id, weak_label
FROM (
 SELECT * FROM positive_samples
 UNION ALL
 SELECT * FROM negative_samples
) AS combined_samples
ORDER BY image_id;
