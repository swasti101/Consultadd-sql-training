Query to create the Temp_BestQuality table:

CREATE TABLE Temp_BestQuality AS
SELECT 
    ai.account_id,
    i.type, 
    MAX(
        CASE 
            WHEN ai.quality = 'common' THEN 1
            WHEN ai.quality = 'rare' THEN 2
            WHEN ai.quality = 'epic' THEN 3
        END
    ) AS max_quality
FROM account_items ai
JOIN items i ON ai.item_id = i.id
GROUP BY ai.account_id, i.type
order by ai.account_id, i.type;




Query to find the final output:

SELECT 
    a.username,
    i.type,
    CASE 
        WHEN bq.max_quality = 3 THEN 'epic'
        WHEN bq.max_quality = 2 THEN 'rare'
        ELSE 'common'
    END AS advised_quality,
    GROUP_CONCAT(i.name ORDER BY i.name SEPARATOR ', ') AS advised_name
FROM account_items ai
JOIN items i ON ai.item_id = i.id
JOIN accounts a ON ai.account_id = a.id
JOIN Temp_BestQuality bq 
    ON ai.account_id = bq.account_id 
    AND i.type = bq.type 
    AND (CASE 
            WHEN ai.quality = 'common' THEN 1
            WHEN ai.quality = 'rare' THEN 2
            WHEN ai.quality = 'epic' THEN 3
        END) = bq.max_quality
GROUP BY a.username, i.type, bq.max_quality
ORDER BY a.username, i.type;
